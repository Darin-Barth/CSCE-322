# CSCE-322
Solutions to my Programming Languages and Concepts Class. Note that similar questions are still used in the class and the purpose of this repository is to showcase my programming experience, and not for others to look up the solutions. I will not be responsible for academic integrity issues should anyone else re-use any part of this code for their own assignments. <br />

Homework 1: Scanning and Parsing with ANTLR. <br />
In part 1, given an elaborate maze encoding and specific rules, we had to make sure that the given maze had valid tokens. In part 2, we had to check various conditions that are given in the attached pdf. <br />

Homework 2: Elaborate Maze with Javascript. <br />
Given a list of moves and a maze, we had to apply those moves to the respective players and return the resulting maze. Again, it is well documented in the attached pdf. <br />

Homework 3: Elaborate Maze with Haskell. <br />
Exactly the same as homework 2 but by using Haskell. <br />

Homework 4: Prolog <br />
Part 1: Determine if the number of moves, rows in the Maze and columns in the Maze are all even or all odd. <br />
Part 2: Determine if no more than 70% of the locations in the Maze are walls (x).  <br />
Part 4: Return the number of open neighbors of a given player in a given maze. <br />
